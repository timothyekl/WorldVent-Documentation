<h1>Bulletins</h1>

<p>
The WorldVent apps for iOS and Android allow use to send a brief bulletin that will be displayed 
the next time the user launches the app on their device.  Only the most recent bulletin
will be displayed, and the bulletin is only displayed once.
</p>

<h2>The index.json file</h2>
<p>
	The core of the bulletin system is a small json file, stored at a known address 
	â€” currently <code>https://worldvent.timekl.com/content/index.json</code>
</p>
<p> This json file indicates the URL of the current bulletin, and also the date on which it was 
	last updated.  When apps start up, they try to retrieve the bulletin information; should
	the server be inaccessible, the apps proceed as normal without delay.
</p>
<p>If a new bulletin is found, the app displays the bulletin and records the update date for that bulletin. Bulletins that have already been shown to the user are ignored.
