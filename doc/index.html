<h1>Overview</h1>


<p>The academic and corporate world has a moral imperative, in this moment, to work in concert to bring the best care and technology possible to countries impacted by the Corono-19 pandemic.</p>
 
<p>
The  WorldVent ventilator addresses the unique requirements associated with respiratory distress due to the onset of an epidemic or pandemic disease state.  The  ventilator system can be manufactured quickly with minimal skill requirements for use by providers and employed rapidly in response to epidemic respiratory disease conditions.
</p>

<p>
	WorldView is suitable
for pandemics, disasters,
areas of conflict in
metropolitan and
austere low resourced
settings. Is to be used in
ICUs, general hospital
rooms, as well as for
patient transport. The
robust construction
resistant to dust, dirt,
water and shock, is
lightweight, with an
intuitive user experience for providers
with limited ventilator
experience.</p>
